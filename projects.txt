## Let's Troubleshoot Your Image Filter Code

**Understanding the Issue:**

It seems that the blur and other filters aren't applying correctly to the image. 

**Potential Causes:**

1. **Incorrect filter property:** The CSS filter property might not support all the filters you're trying to apply, or there might be browser compatibility issues.
2. **Filter value range:** The values you're setting for filters might be outside the acceptable range.
3. **Image loading and application timing:** The filters might not be applied correctly due to image loading and script execution timing.
4. **Canvas rendering issues:** If you're using a canvas to apply filters, there could be problems with the canvas context or image drawing.

**Debugging Steps:**

1. **Console log filter values:** Check if the filter values are being set correctly by logging them to the console.
2. **Simplify the code:** Temporarily remove some filters to isolate the issue.
3. **Test different image formats:** Try using different image formats (JPEG, PNG) to see if the problem persists.
4. **Check browser compatibility:** Ensure that the filters are supported by the browsers you're testing.
5. **Inspect the canvas:** If using a canvas, visually inspect the canvas output to identify any rendering issues.
6. **Use CSS filter inspector:** Use browser developer tools to inspect the applied filters and their effects.

**Code Modifications:**

While we troubleshoot, consider these potential improvements:

* **Combine filter values:** Instead of multiple filter properties, you can combine them into a single string for better performance.
* **Use CSS variables:** Store filter values in CSS variables for easier management.
* **Add error handling:** Implement error handling to catch potential issues and provide informative messages.

**Example:**

```javascript
previewImg.style.filter = `brightness(${brightness}%) saturate(${saturation}%) invert(${inversion}%) grayscale(${grayscale}%) blur(${blurImg}px) contrast(${contrast}%) hue-rotate(${huerotate}deg) sepia(${sepia}%)`;
```

By combining filters into a single string, you can simplify the code and potentially improve performance.

**Let me know if you need more specific guidance or if you've tried any of these steps.** We can work through the issue together.
